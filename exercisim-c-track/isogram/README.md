# isogram

This repository contains a solution for the Two Fer exercise from Exercism in C.

## problem description

Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "non-pattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms:

lumberjacks
background
downstream
six-year-old
The word isograms, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.

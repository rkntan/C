## problem description

Your task is to determine what you will say as you give away the extra cookie.

If you know the person's name (e.g. if they're named Do-yun), then you will say:

> One for Do-yun, one for me.

If you don't know the person's name, you will say you instead.

> One for you, one for me.

### Example:

|Name|	Dialogue|
|:---|---:|
|Alice|	One for Alice, one for me.
|Bohdan|	One for Bohdan, one for me.
||One for you, one for me.
|Zaphod|	One for Zaphod, one for me.


Your task is to count the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of a number.
